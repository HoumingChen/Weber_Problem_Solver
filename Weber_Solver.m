function Opt_Location = Weber_Solver(W,X,Y0,err)
%   Weber_Solver Opt_Location = Weber_Solver(W,X,Y0) produces the optimal 
%   solution to the Fermat-Weber porblem in a weighted situation. 
%   This function is a realization of the algorithm written in 
%   'Iterative solutions of the Fermat, Weber and attraction-repulsion 
%   problems', from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_problem.
%   W is a row vector of size n, composed of weights of each point. X is a 
%   2-by-n matrix composed of n 2D column vectors. Y0 is a column vector 
%   of size 2 that serves as an initiating point for the optimization. err
%   is a scalar value determining the precision degree of the optimization.
%   The suggestion of default value is 0.001.

function distance = get_Distance(X,Y0)
%   GET_DISTANCE distance = get_Distance(X,Y0) calculates the distance
%   between two matrices composed by column vectors. It is different
%   and may not be replaceable with the built-in function dist() because
%   get_Distance processes multiple vectors at one time.

function Y_next = KK_method(W,X,Y0)
%   KK_METHOD [Y_next, Y0] = KK_method(Y_next,Y0) completes the algorithm
%   by computing all ingredients together. This algorithm was proposed by 
%   Kuhn and Kuenne (1962). <Kuhn, Harold W. and Robert E. Kuenne, 
%   1962, "An Efficient Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the 
%   Generalized Weber Problem in Spatial Economics."

function TorF = loop_condition_check(Y0,Y_next,err)
%   LOOP_CONDITION_CHECK TorF = loop_condition_check(Y0,Y_next) 
%   checks if the Y0 has converged properly Y_next. If the difference
%   between Y_next and Y0 can be regarded as infinitesimal (based on the
%   user's standard), Y_next is then good enough to output. Otherwise, this
%   judgement leads to next round optimization.

function distribution_plotter(W,X)
%   DISTRIBUTION_PLOTTER distribution_plotter(W,X) maps out the location of

function trace_plotter(p1,p2)
